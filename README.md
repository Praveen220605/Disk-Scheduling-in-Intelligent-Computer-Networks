💽 Disk Scheduling in Intelligent Computer Networks (ICN)

This project implements disk scheduling algorithms used in Intelligent Computer Networks to manage and optimize disk I/O operations. It helps compare total head movements across algorithms to identify the most efficient method.

📌 Algorithms Covered
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- SCAN
- LOOK
- C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
- C-LOOK

📊 Project Highlights
- Input: Disk request queue, head start position
- Output: Head movements and performance comparison
- Suitable for ICN and OS education

🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib (for visualization)

▶️ How to Run
1. Clone/download the repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter
3. Run the notebook to see outputs and plots
