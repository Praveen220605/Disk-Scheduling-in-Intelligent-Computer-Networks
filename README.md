# Disk-Scheduling-in-Intelligent-Computer-Networks
This project demonstrates how various disk scheduling algorithms—such as FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, LOOK, C-SCAN, and C-LOOK—optimize disk access in Intelligent Computer Networks (ICN). It compares their performance by calculating total head movements based on different disk request sequences.
